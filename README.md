The purpose of this project is simple: 
  implement a custom UART protocol to demonstrate my understanding of it.

The project can be understood by reading main.c. 
If you wanted to run it, simply create an ESP-IDF project configured to your MCU and copy the source code. 
Then, build, run, and monitor within your IDE.
